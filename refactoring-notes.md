# Refactoring Notes

This document tracks additional observations and potential improvements noticed during the step-by-step refactoring process. These items will be addressed after completing all planned phases and steps.

## Format
Each entry should include:
- Phase/Step where it was noticed
- Description of the observation/issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested solution (if applicable)

## Phase 1, Step 2f Observations
1. The changes were split across two sessions due to timeout, but we successfully:
   - Removed the old update_prompt method that used display_idx
   - Implemented all new move and edit methods as specified
2. The move_prompt_list_order method could potentially benefit from a bounds check on the target_order before attempting to find a target prompt
3. The edit_content method's validation is minimal (just checking for None) - we might want to consider additional validation in the future if needed
4. All the new methods consistently follow the pattern of:
   - Validating prompt_id exists
   - Performing specific validation
   - Making changes
   - Saving
   This consistent pattern could be documented as a best practice for future method additions
