# CroqLI Critical Issues

## Currently Working (But Basic)
1. Application Startup ✅
   - Basic initialization
   - Menu display
   - Groq API connection

2. Chat Mode (Partially) ✅
   - Basic message sending/receiving
   - Debug output verbose but functional

## Immediate Focus (Independent Features)
1. Search Mode ✅
   - Basic search functionality working
   - Tavily API integration complete
   - Basic results formatting implemented

2. CLI Assistant Mode ❌
   - Should work independently of system prompts
   - Basic command execution needed

## Secondary Priorities
1. System Prompts Menu
   - Required for enhanced chat/search/CLI functionality
   - But not blocking basic operations

2. Settings & Configuration
   - Model settings can wait (using defaults)
   - Not critical for basic functionality

## Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
1. Advanced Search Features
   - Implement additional Tavily API options:
     - Topic filtering
     - Time range controls
     - Search depth customization
     - Domain inclusion/exclusion
     - Raw content options
     - Image handling options
   - Add alternative search providers:
     - EXA-search API integration
     - Compare and combine search results
     - Provider-specific advanced features

## Postponed
- Chat mode debug output cleanup
- Tool Usage implementation
- Response handling improvements
- Configuration persistence

## Action Plan
1. ✅ Fix Search Mode
   - Basic search functionality
   - Error handling
   - Results display

2. Fix CLI Assistant Mode
   - Command execution
   - Basic response handling
   - Safety checks

3. Then choose between:
   - System Prompts implementation
   - OR Settings & Configuration

NOTE: Focus on making features work independently first, then integrate them better later.
